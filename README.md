Lao PDF to Word Converter
Concept:

This web application allows users to convert PDF documents containing Lao text into fully editable Microsoft Word (.docx) documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.

Features:

File Upload: Users can upload PDF files for conversion.
Lao Language Support: The OCR library used should specifically support recognizing Lao characters.
Conversion to Editable Word: The output should be a Microsoft Word compatible (.docx) document where the text is fully editable.
Download Functionality: Users can download the converted Word document.
Processing Notification: Users should be notified when the conversion process is complete and the file is ready for download. This could be achieved through a progress bar, a message, or a download button that becomes enabled.
Technical Specifications:

Frontend: A user-friendly interface for uploading PDFs and downloading converted documents. Consider using a framework like React or Vue.js for a smooth user experience.
Backend: A server-side script to handle file upload, OCR processing using a Lao-supporting library (e.g., Tesseract with Lao language pack), and Word document generation. Libraries like Apache POI can be used for creating docx files.
OCR Library: Integrate an OCR library specifically trained for Lao characters. Tesseract with a Lao language pack is a popular option.
Deployment: The application can be deployed on a cloud platform like Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services for scalability and accessibility.
Success Criteria:

Users can upload Lao PDFs and download editable Word documents.
The converted documents are compatible with Microsoft Word.
Users are clearly notified when the conversion is complete and the file is ready for download.
Additional Considerations:

Implement security measures to protect user uploaded files.
Consider adding functionalities like batch conversion or file size limitations.
Design a responsive interface that works well on various devices.
